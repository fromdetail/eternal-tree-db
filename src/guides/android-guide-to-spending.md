Requires making a new JP google play account and linking Paypal. This method works even if you game is linked to a different google account.

I did this on my phone but it should work on Bluestacks/LDplayer (recommended to use fresh instance as you will need to log out of any other accounts in Play Store)

*\*You can also use an existing account and change the region to JP but if you do so you will lose any play credits you may have and will be unable to use that account for EN store.*

*\*PSA: You cant make a JP Google Play account and then do a gift card top up. Google now requires you to physically be in that region to add gift codes. Vpns do not work and there is no work around atm.*



## Creating Account

1. Download VPN (TunnelBear) and create account

2. Connect to Japan in TunnelBear (just click on the country and should auto connect)

\* Do not disconnect until all payment is linked

3. Open Google Play Store, navigate to menu and hit "Add another account"

4. Complete account creation as normal

5. Once created ensure you are logged into the new account in the play store and confirm it is in Japanese (multiple ways below)

*\* Ads at top should be in Japanese*

*\* you should be able to search and find エターナルツリー or other JP on games in the play store*

*\* Under Settings -> General -> Account and Device Preference: Country should be listed as Japan*



## Setting Up Payment

This part can vary based on how what credit/debit cards you have and your paypal account

1. Navigate to Payments and Subscriptions

2. Add a credit/debit card and when asked for a zipcode use Japan as country with a JP zipcode (XXX-XXXX)

\* Some cards may not be able to be linked (based on your bank/card)

3. Recommended to add Paypal as a back up payment method as this seems to get around some cards being rejected

*\* If you link paypal first your address may get auto set to wherever you live (not Japan) and you may be unable to use the account*



Spending Money

1. Turn VPN Off (Game will not load if connect to VPN)

2. Open Game and buy things (I recommend using paypal as some cards can cause issues after 1st payment)

*\* If the game is pulling up the wrong google play account for payment you need to log off of that account in the play store and relaunch the game and it should switch to the correct account*

*\* If for some reason your in game purchase with a card gets rejected when attempting to spend money you may need to create a new account with a different zip code*\
